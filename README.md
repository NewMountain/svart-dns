# svart-dns
A Next Gen DNS

This project was created by a long-time user (and admirer) of AdGuard and Pi-Hole. There were just enough features I wish I had that I decided to build my own as a learning exercise and fun challenge. These features are:

* Better Visualize use and trends
* Ability to Load Balance custom domains to IP addresses
* Ability to perform "what if" scenarios between different block lists
* Easily associate DNS users with user defined names
* Apply rules as user and/or group and/or range level
* HTTPS by default (and auto-gen a self-signed cert if you don't provide one)

If everything goes according to plan, this project will be fast, easy to host, space efficient and delightful to use.

If all goes according to plan, I hope you'll enjoy it as well.

Note: As of Sunday 8th 2024, this is under heavy active development and is intended only for developers at this time. As this project matures and stabilizes, it will transition to a more-user friendly appearance designed for "download and run" usage.

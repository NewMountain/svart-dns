# svart-dns
A Next Gen DNS

I created this project as a love letter to AdGuard and Pi-Hole. As a long-time user of both, there were just enough features I wish I had that I decided to build my own. These features are:

* Better Visualize use and trends
* Ability to Load Balance custom domains to IP addresses
* Ability to perform "what if" scenarios between different block lists
* Easily associate DNS users with user defined names
* Apply rules as user and/or group and/or range level
* HTTPS by default (and auto-gen a self-signed cert if you don't provide one)

If everything goes according to plan, this project will be fast, easy to host, space efficient and delightful to use.

Note: As of Sunday 8th 2024, this is under heavy active development and is intended only for developers at this time. As this project matures and stabilizes, it will transition to a more-user friendly appearance designed for "download and run" usage.
